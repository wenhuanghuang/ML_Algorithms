## Implementation of Neural Nets with Python 

The task is to classify hand-written digits from 0 to 9(MNIST DATASET) More info can be found in http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Multi-layer perceptron(MLP) architecture: 

- linear
- relu / tanh
- dropout
- linear
- softmax
- predicted label  

The neural net model reaches 0.956 on validation set, 0.998 on training set with mini-batch gradient descent on 10 epoch

This is an assignment from USC CSCI567 Machine Learning.
